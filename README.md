# [QIFY](https://qify.app/)

A simple web interface to have multiple people add music to your spotify song queue.

## Use cases

- In a car, you are driving, everyone can still **add music**.
- At a party, you are **away** with the boy/girl of your dreams, no need to hand your password to everyone who wants to **change the music**
  - No one has access to your **master password** ðŸ˜‰
- If you have **bad** music taste, it'll be sunk into the rest of the songs
<!-- - Some friends prefer Deezer ? Tidal ? They don't have a spotify account ? **It still works** ! -->

## Auth

Only the main user, also called room admin has to connect to his spotify account. All others do not even need to be connected.
